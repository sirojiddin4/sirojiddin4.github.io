          <strong>Electroreception</strong></span></h1>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <strong>A</strong>
          Open your eyes in sea water and it is difficult to see much more than
          a murky, bleary green colour. Sounds, too, are garbled and difficult
          to comprehend. Without specialised equipment humans would be lost in
          these deep sea habitats, so how do fish make it seem so easy? Much of
          this is due to a biological phenomenon known as electroreception – the
          ability to perceive and act upon electrical stimuli as part of the
          overall senses. This ability is only found in aquatic or amphibious
          species because water is an efficient conductor of electricity. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>B</strong>
          Electroreception comes in two variants. While all animals (including
          humans) generate electric signals, because they are emitted by the
          nervous system, some animals have the ability – known as passive
          electroreception – to receive and decode electric signals generated by
          other animals in order to sense their location. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>C</strong>
          Other creatures can go further still, however. Animals
          with active electroreception possess bodily organs that generate
          special electric signals on cue. These can be used for mating signals
          and territorial displays as well as locating objects in the water.
          Active electroreceptors can differentiate between the various
          resistances that their electrical currents encounter. This can help
          them identify whether another creature is prey, predator or something
          that is best left alone. Active electroreception has a range of about
          one body length – usually just enough to give its host time to get out
          of the way or go in for the kill. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>D </strong>One
          fascinating use of active electroreception – known as the Jamming
          Avoidance Response mechanism – has been observed between members of
          some species known as the weakly electric fish. When two such electric
          fish meet in the ocean using the same frequency, each fish will then
          shift the frequency of its discharge so that they are transmitting on
          different frequencies. Doing so prevents their electroreception
          faculties from becoming jammed. Long before citizens’ band radio users
          first had to yell “Get off my frequency!” at hapless novices
          cluttering the air waves, at least one species had found a way to
          peacefully and quickly resolve this type of dispute. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>E</strong>
          Electroreception can also play an important role in animal defences.
          Rays are one such example. Young ray embryos develop inside egg cases
          that are attached to the sea bed. The embryos keep their tails in
          constant motion so as to pump water and allow them to breathe through
          the egg’s casing. If the embryo’s electroreceptors detect the presence
          of a predatory fish in the vicinity, however, the embryo stops moving
          (and in so doing ceases transmitting electric currents) until the fish
          has moved on. Because marine life of various types is often travelling
          past, the embryo has evolved only to react to signals that are
          characteristic of the respiratory movements of potential predators
          such as sharks. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>F</strong>
          Many people fear swimming in the ocean because of sharks. In some
          respects, this concern is well grounded – humans are poorly equipped
          when it comes to electroreceptive defence mechanisms. Sharks,
          meanwhile, hunt with extraordinary precision. They initially lock onto
          their prey through a keen sense of smell (two thirds of a shark’s
          brain is devoted entirely to its olfactory organs). As the shark
          reaches proximity to its prey, it tunes into electric signals that
          ensure a precise strike on its target; this sense is so strong that
          the shark even attacks blind by letting its eyes recede for
          protection. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>G</strong>
          Normally, when humans are attacked it is purely by accident. Since
          sharks cannot detect from electroreception whether or not something
          will satisfy their tastes, they tend to “try before they buy”, taking
          one or two bites and then assessing the results (our sinewy muscle
          does not compare well with plumper, softer prey such as seals). Repeat
          attacks are highly likely once a human is bleeding, however; the force
          of the electric field is heightened by salt in the blood which creates
          the perfect setting for a feeding frenzy. In areas where shark attacks
          on humans are likely to occur, scientists are exploring ways to create
          artificial electroreceptors that would disorient the sharks and repel
          them from swimming beaches. <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>H</strong>
          There is much that we do not yet know concerning how electroreception
          functions. Although researchers have documented how electroreception
          alters hunting, defence and communication systems through observation,
          the exact neurological processes that encode and decode this
          information are unclear. Scientists are also exploring the role
          electroreception plays in navigation. Some have proposed that salt
          water and magnetic fields from the Earth’s core may interact to form
          electrical currents that sharks use for migratory purposes. </span></p>
